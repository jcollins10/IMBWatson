Here are the results from each of the three different types of tests

1. Results when testing with neither using lemmatization or stemming:

Running the BM25 model.

Score from using the BM25 model:
	Precision at 1 score: 19/100 = 0.19

Running the vector model with tf/idf.

Score from using the vector space model and tf/idf:
	Precision at 1 score: 0/100 = 0.0

Running the Boolean model.

Score from using the boolean model:
	Precision at 1 score: 12/100 = 0.12

Running the Jelinek Mercer model.

Score from using the Jelinek Mercer model:
	Precision at 1 score: 26/100 = 0.26

2. Results when testing with only lemmatization:
